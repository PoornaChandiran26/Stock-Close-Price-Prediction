# üìà Stock Close Price Prediction for Tata Group Companies

This project focuses on predicting the closing prices of Tata Group‚Äôs listed companies by integrating **web scraping**, **financial sentiment analysis**, and **machine learning models**. It demonstrates how AI and structured financial data can provide actionable insights for investors and analysts.

---

## üß† Problem Statement

Traditional stock prediction models rely heavily on historical price and volume data. In this project, we enhance predictions by incorporating **financial news sentiment**, offering a more comprehensive view of market dynamics.

## üîß Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Web Scraping & Data Management
- Scraped financial news articles using `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`.
- Created a **MySQL database (`STOCK_PREDICTION`)** to store scraped news data along with sentiment and metadata.
- Merged structured historical stock data from Excel sheets into the SQL pipeline for unified data access.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sentiment Analysis with FinBERT
- Used **FinBERT**, a transformer-based NLP model fine-tuned for financial text.
- Classified each article as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**, and stored sentiment scores in SQL.
- Visualized article sentiment distributions and identified key sentiment-driving news.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Stock Close Price Prediction Models
- Trained and evaluated the following models:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
  - **XGBoost**
  - **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- Input Features:
  - Open, High, Low, Volume
  - FinBERT-derived sentiment score
- Evaluated with:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ User Interaction & Insights
- Provided company-specific analysis tools for:
  - Viewing sentiment trends
  - Predicting next-day stock closing prices
  - Visualizing model performance and outputs
